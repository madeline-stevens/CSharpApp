# CSharpApp

## Resolved issues:

1.

Problem/error- This error within terminal after running dotnet run-- "Couldn't find a project to run. Ensure a project exists in /Users/maddys87/Documents/code_projects/CSharpApp, or pass the path to the project using --project."
Solution- I needed the myApp.csproj file which incorporates the .NET sdk into the project.
